        // A session can be replaced by another session by simply calling createCaptureSession on
        // the CameraDevice. Internally this will reconfigure the camera capture session, and there
        // are optimizations present in the CameraFramework and Camera HAL that can optimize how
        // fast the new session is created and started. The most obvious example of this is
        // replacing a surface with a new one after recording a video, which can effectively cause
        // the new session to be created and replaced without dropping a frame.
        //
        // Second, a session can be _stopped_ by calling stopRepeating and/or abortCaptures. This
        // keeps the session alive but may abort pending requests. In some cases it's faster to
        // switch sessions if these methods are invoked before creating a new session on the
        // device because requests that are in-flight can be explicitly aborted.

        // or disconnected. This can happen if a higher priority process steals the camera, or
        // during switches from one camera to another.
