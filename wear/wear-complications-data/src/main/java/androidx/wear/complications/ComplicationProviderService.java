/**
 * Class for providers of complication data.
 *
 * <p>A provider service must implement {@link #onComplicationUpdate} to respond to requests for
 * updates from the complication system.
 *
 * <p>Manifest requirements:
 * <ul>
 * <il>The manifest declaration of this service must include an intent filter for
 * android.support.wearable.complications.ACTION_COMPLICATION_UPDATE_REQUEST.</il>
 *
 * <il>A ComplicationProviderService must include a {@code meta-data} tag with
 * android.support.wearable.complications.SUPPORTED_TYPES in its manifest entry. The value of
 * this tag should be a comma separated list of types supported by
 * the provider. Types should be given as named as per the type fields in the {@link
 * ComplicationData}, but omitting the "TYPE_" prefix, e.g. {@code SHORT_TEXT}, {@code
 * LONG_TEXT}, {@code RANGED_VALUE}.
 *
 * <p>The order in which types are listed has no significance. In the case where a watch face
 * supports multiple types in a single complication slot, the watch face will determine which
 * types it prefers.
 *
 * <p>For example, a provider that supports the RANGED_VALUE, SHORT_TEXT, and ICON types would
 * include the following in its manifest entry:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * &lt;meta-data android:name="android.support.wearable.complications.SUPPORTED_TYPES"
 *         android:value="RANGED_VALUE,SHORT_TEXT,ICON"/&gt;</pre>
 * </il>
 *
 * <il>A ComplicationProviderService should include a {@code meta-data} tag with
 * android.support.wearable.complications.UPDATE_PERIOD_SECONDS its manifest entry. The value of
 * this tag is the number of seconds the provider would like to elapse between update requests.
 *
 * <p>Note that update requests are not guaranteed to be sent with this frequency.
 *
 * <p>If a provider never needs to receive update requests beyond the one sent when a
 * complication is activated, the value of this tag should be 0.
 *
 * <p>For example, a provider that would like to update every ten minutes should include the
 * following in its manifest entry:
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * &lt;meta-data android:name="android.support.wearable.complications.UPDATE_PERIOD_SECONDS"
 *         android:value="600"/&gt;</pre>
 * </il>
 *
 * <il>A ComplicationProviderService can include a {@code meta-data} tag with
 * android.support.wearable.complications.PROVIDER_CONFIG_ACTION its manifest entry to cause a
 * configuration activity to be shown when the provider is selected.
 *
 * <p>The configuration activity must reside in the same package as the provider, and must
 * register an intent filter for the action specified here, including
 * android.support.wearable.complications.category.PROVIDER_CONFIG as well as
 * {@link Intent#CATEGORY_DEFAULT} as categories.
 *
 * <p>The complication id being configured will be included in the intent that starts the config
 * activity using the extra key android.support.wearable.complications.EXTRA_CONFIG_COMPLICATION_ID.
 *
 * <p>The complication type that will be requested from the provider will also be included,
 * using the extra key android.support.wearable.complications.EXTRA_CONFIG_COMPLICATION_TYPE.
 *
 * <p>The provider's {@link ComponentName} will also be included in the intent that starts the
 * config activity, using the extra key
 * android.support.wearable.complications.EXTRA_CONFIG_PROVIDER_COMPONENT.
 *
 * <p>The config activity must call {@link Activity#setResult} with either {@link
 * Activity#RESULT_OK} or {@link Activity#RESULT_CANCELED} before it is finished, to tell the
 * system whether or not the provider should be set on the given complication.</il>
 *
 * <il>The manifest entry for the service should also include an android:icon attribute. The icon
 * provided there should be a single-color white icon that represents the provider. This icon will
 * be shown in the provider chooser interface, and may also be included in {@link
 * ComplicationProviderInfo} given to watch faces for display in their configuration activities.
 * </il>
 *
 * <il>The manifest entry should also include {@code
 * android:permission="com.google.android.wearable.permission.BIND_COMPLICATION_PROVIDER"} to ensure
 * that only the system can bind to it.</il>
 * </ul>
