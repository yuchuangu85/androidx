/**
 * Studio version information used for setting up the correct version of Android Studio.
 *
 * Note: Android Gradle Plugin version is needed as part of configuring the build, so it is
 * defined separately in build_dependencies.gradle.
 *
 * Once you have a chosen version of AGP to upgrade to, go to
 * https://developer.android.com/studio/archive and find the matching version of Studio.
 * For example, if you are upgrading to AGP 3.6 alpha 05, look for the Studio 3.6 canary 5 build.
 * (alpha maps to canary, beta to beta, rc to rc, and no suffix for stable in both cases)
 *
 * The download url should contain: ...ide-zips/3.6.0.5/android-studio-ide-191.5721125-linux...
 * From this, the first number (3.6.0.5) is [studioVersion], the first number in the filename (192)
 * is the [ideaMajorVersion] and the last number (5721125) is the [studioBuildNumber].
