/**
 * Configure touch dragging for the UI element in a single [Orientation]. The drag distance is
 * reported to [onDrag] as a single [Float] value in pixels.
 *
 * The common usecase for this component is when you need to be able to drag something
 * inside the component on the screen and represent this state via one float value
 *
 * If you need to control the whole dragging flow, consider using [dragGestureFilter] instead.
 *
 * If you are implementing scroll/fling behavior, consider using [scrollable].
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.foundation.samples.DraggableSample
 *
 * @param orientation orientation of the drag
 * @param enabled whether or not drag is enabled
 * @param reverseDirection reverse the direction of the scroll, so top to bottom scroll will
 * behave like bottom to top and left to right will behave like right to left.
 * @param interactionState [InteractionState] that will be updated when this draggable is
 * being dragged, using [Interaction.Dragged].
 * @param startDragImmediately when set to true, draggable will start dragging immediately and
 * prevent other gesture detectors from reacting to "down" events (in order to block composed
 * press-based gestures).  This is intended to allow end users to "catch" an animating widget by
 * pressing on it. It's useful to set it when value you're dragging is settling / animating.
 * @param canDrag callback to indicate whether or not dragging is allowed for given [Direction]
 * @param onDragStarted callback that will be invoked when drag has been started after touch slop
 * has been passed, with starting position provided
 * @param onDragStopped callback that will be invoked when drag stops, with velocity provided
 * @param onDrag callback to be invoked when the drag occurs with the delta dragged from the
 * previous event. [Density] provided in the scope for the convenient conversion between px and dp
