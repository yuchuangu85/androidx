/**
 * Composes an Android [View] obtained from [viewBlock]. The [viewBlock] block will be called
 * exactly once to obtain the [View] to be composed, and it is also guaranteed to be invoked on
 * the UI thread. Therefore, in addition to creating the [viewBlock], the block can also be used
 * to perform one-off initializations and [View] constant properties' setting.
 * The [update] block can be run multiple times (on the UI thread as well) due to recomposition,
 * and it is the right place to set [View] properties depending on state. When state changes,
 * the block will be reexecuted to set the new properties. Note the block will also be ran once
 * right after the [viewBlock] block completes.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.AndroidViewSample
 *
 * @param viewBlock The block creating the [View] to be composed.
 * @param modifier The modifier to be applied to the layout.
 * @param update The callback to be invoked after the layout is inflated.
