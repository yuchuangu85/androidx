 * displaying visual feedback for those two states.
 *
 * More specifically:
 * - It will call [onStart] if the first pointer down it receives during the
 * [PointerEventPass.Main] pass is not consumed.
 * - It will call [onStop] if [onStart] has been called and the last [PointerInputChange] it
 * receives during the [PointerEventPass.Main] pass has an up change, consumed or not, indicating
 * the press gesture indication should end.
 * - It will call [onCancel] if movement has been consumed by the time of the
 * [PointerEventPass.Final] pass, indicating that the press gesture indication should end because
 * something moved.
 *
 * This gesture detector always consumes the down change during the [PointerEventPass.Main] pass.
