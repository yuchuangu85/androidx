/**
 * This gesture detector detects dragging in any direction.
 *
 * Note: By default, this gesture detector only waits for a single pointer to have moved to start
 * dragging.  It is extremely likely that you don't want to use this gesture detector directly, but
 * instead use a drag gesture detector that does wait for some other condition to have occurred
 * (such as [dragGestureFilter] which waits for a single pointer to have passed touch
 * slop before dragging starts).
 *
 * Dragging begins when the a single pointer has moved and either [canStartDragging] is null or
 * returns true.  When dragging begins, [DragObserver.onStart] is called.  [DragObserver.onDrag] is
 * then continuously called whenever the average movement of all pointers has movement along the x
 * or y axis.  The gesture ends with either a call to [DragObserver.onStop] or
 * [DragObserver.onCancel], only after [DragObserver.onStart] is called. [DragObserver.onStop] is
 * called when the dragging ends due to all of the pointers no longer interacting with the
 * DragGestureDetector (for example, the last pointer has been lifted off of the
 * DragGestureDetector). [DragObserver.onCancel] is called when the dragging ends due to a system
 * cancellation event.
 *
 * When multiple pointers are touching the detector, the drag distance is taken as the average of
 * all of the pointers.
 *
 * Note: Changing the value of [orientation] will reset the gesture filter such that it will not
 * respond to input until new pointers are detected.
 *
 * @param dragObserver The callback interface to report all events related to dragging.
 * @param canStartDragging If set, Before dragging is started ([DragObserver.onStart] is called),
 *                         canStartDragging is called to check to see if it is allowed to start.
 * @param orientation Limits the directions under which dragging can occur to those that are
 *                    within the provided orientation, locks pointers that are used to drag in
 *                    the given orientation to that orientation, and ignores pointers that are
 *                    locked to other orientations.  If no orientation is provided, does none of
 *                    the above.
