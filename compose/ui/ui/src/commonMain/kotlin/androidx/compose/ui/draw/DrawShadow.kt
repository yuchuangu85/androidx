/**
 * Creates a [DrawLayerModifier] that draws the shadow. The [elevation] defines the visual
 * depth of the physical object. The physical object has a shape specified by [shape].
 *
 * Note that [elevation] is only affecting the shadow size and doesn't change the drawing order.
 * Use [zIndex] modifier if you want to draw the elements with larger [elevation] after all the
 * elements with a smaller one.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.ui.samples.DrawShadowSample
 *
 * @param elevation The elevation for the shadow in pixels
 * @param shape Defines a shape of the physical object
 * @param clip When active, the content drawing clips to the shape.
 * @param opacity The opacity of the layer, including the shadow.
