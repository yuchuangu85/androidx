/**
 * Like [Modifier.dragGestureFilter], this gesture filter will detect dragging, but will only do

 *
 * This gesture filter also disambiguates amongst other scrollGestureFilters such that for all
 * pointers that this gesture filter uses to scroll in the given [orientation], other
 * scrollGestureFilters (or other clients of [ScrollOrientationLocker]) will not use those same
 * pointers to drag in the other [orientation].  Likewise, this scrollGestureFilter will not use
 * pointers to drag if they are already being used to drag in a different orientation.
 *
 * Note: [canDrag] will only be queried in directions that exist within the given [orientation].
 *
 * Note: Changing the value of [orientation] will reset the gesture filter such that it will not
 * respond to input until new pointers are detected.
 *
 * @param scrollCallback: The set of callbacks for scrolling.
 * @param orientation: The orientation this gesture filter uses.
 * @param canDrag Set to limit the types of directions under which touch slop can be exceeded.
 * Return true if you want a drag to be started due to the touch slop being surpassed in the
 * given [Direction]. If [canDrag] is not provided, touch slop will be able to be exceeded in all
 * directions that are in the provided [orientation].
 * @param startDragImmediately Set to true to have dragging begin immediately when a pointer is
 * "down", preventing children from responding to the "down" change.  Generally, this parameter
 * should be set to true when the child of the GestureDetector is animating, such that when a finger
 * touches it, dragging is immediately started so the animation stops and dragging can occur.
