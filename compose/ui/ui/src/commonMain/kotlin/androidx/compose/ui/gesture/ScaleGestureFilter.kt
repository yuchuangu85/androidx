/**
 * This gesture detector detects scaling.
 *
 * Scaling is when the average distance between a set of pointers changes over time.  It is
 * also known as pinch, or pinch to zoom.
 *
 * Scaling begins when the average distance between a set of pointers changes and at least 1 pointer
 * moves beyond the touch slop distance (currently defined by [TouchSlop]).  When scaling begins,
 * [ScaleObserver.onStart] is called followed immediately by a call to [ScaleObserver.onScale].
 * [ScaleObserver.onScale] is then continuously called whenever the movement of pointers denotes
 * scaling. The gesture stops with either a call to [RawScaleObserver.onStop] or
 * [RawScaleObserver.onCancel], either of which will only be called if [RawScaleObserver.onStart]
 * was previously called. [RawScaleObserver.onStop] is called when no pointers remain.
 * [RawScaleObserver.onCancel] is called due to a system cancellation event.
 *
 * This gesture detector is similar to [rawScaleGestureFilter] except that it is made for more
 * standard use cases where touch slop should likely be respected and no "nested scaling" is
 * needed.
 *
 * @param scaleObserver The callback interface to report all events related to scaling.
