/**
 * This gesture detector detects scaling.
 *
 * Scaling is when the average distance between a set of pointers changes over time.  It is
 * also known as pinch, or pinch to zoom.
 *
 * Note: By default, this gesture detector will start as soon as the average distance between
 * pointers changes by just a little bit. It is likely that you don't want to use this gesture
 * detector directly, but instead use a scale gesture detector that is less aggressive about
 * starting (such as [rawScaleGestureFilter] which waits for a pointer to have passed touch slop
 * before starting).
 *
 * Scaling begins when the average distance between a set of pointers changes and either
 * [canStartScaling] is null or returns true.  When scaling begins, [RawScaleObserver.onStart] is
 * called followed immediately by a call to [RawScaleObserver.onScale].
 * [RawScaleObserver.onScale] is then continuously called whenever the movement of all pointers
 * denotes scaling. The gesture stops with either a call to [RawScaleObserver.onStop] or
 * [RawScaleObserver.onCancel], either of which will only be called if [RawScaleObserver.onStart]
 * was previously called. [RawScaleObserver.onStop] is called when no pointers remain.
 * [RawScaleObserver.onCancel] is called due to a system cancellation event.
 *
 * @param scaleObserver The callback interface to report all events related to scaling.
 * @param canStartScaling If set, before scaling is started ([RawScaleObserver.onStart] is called),
 * canStartScaling is called for each pointer event to check to see if it is allowed to start.
