/**
 * Immutable constraints used for measuring child Layouts or [LayoutModifier]s. A parent layout
 * can measure their children using the measure method on the corresponding [Measurable]s,
 * method which takes the [Constraints] the child has to follow. A measured child is then
 * responsible to choose for themselves and return a size which satisfies the set of [Constraints]
 * received from their parent:
 * - minWidth <= chosenWidth <= maxWidth
 * - minHeight <= chosenHeight <= maxHeight
 * The parent can then access the child chosen size on the resulting [Placeable]. The parent is
 * responsible of defining a valid positioning of the children according to their sizes, so the
 * parent needs to measure the children with appropriate [Constraints], such that whatever valid
 * sizes children choose, they can be laid out in a way that also respects the parent's incoming
 * [Constraints]. Note that different children can be measured with different [Constraints].
 * A child is allowed to choose a size that does not satisfy its constraints. However, when this
 * happens, the parent will not read from the [Placeable] the real size of the child, but rather
 * one that was coerced in the child's constraints; therefore, a parent can assume that its
 * children will always respect the constraints in their layout algorithm. When this does not
 * happen in reality, the position assigned to the child will be automatically offset to be centered
 * on the space assigned by the parent under the assumption that constraints were respected.
 * A set of [Constraints] can have infinite maxWidth and/or maxHeight. This is a trick often
 * used by parents to ask their children for their preferred size: unbounded constraints force
 * children whose default behavior is to fill the available space (always size to
 * maxWidth/maxHeight) to have an opinion about their preferred size. Most commonly, when measured
 * with unbounded [Constraints], these children will fallback to size themselves to wrap their
 * content, instead of expanding to fill the available space (this is not always true
 * as it depends on the child layout model, but is a common behavior for core layout components).
 *
 * [Constraints] uses a [Long] to represent four values, [minWidth], [minHeight], [maxWidth],
 * and [maxHeight]. The range of the values varies to allow for at most 256K in one dimension.
 * There are four possible maximum ranges, 13 bits/18 bits, and 15 bits/16 bits for either width
 * or height, depending on the needs. For example, a width could range up to 18 bits
 * and the height up to 13 bits. Alternatively, the width could range up to 16 bits and the height
 * up to 15 bits. The height and width requirements can be reversed, with a height of up to 18 bits
 * and width of 13 bits or height of 16 bits and width of 15 bits. Any constraints exceeding
 * this range will fail.
