/**
 * [AnimatedVisibility] composable animates the appearance and disappearance of its content, as
 * [visible] value changes. Different [EnterTransition]s and [ExitTransition]s can be defined in
 * [enter] and [exit] for the appearance and disappearance animation. There are 3 types of
 * [EnterTransition] and [ExitTransition]: Fade, Expand/Shrink and Slide. The enter transitions
 * and exit transitions can be combined using `+`. The order of the combination does not matter,
 * as the transition animations will start simultaneously. See [EnterTransition] and
 * [ExitTransition] for details on the three types of transition. Here's an example of combining
 * all three types of transitions together:
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.animation.samples.FullyLoadedTransition
 *
 * This composable function creates a custom [Layout] for its content. The size of the custom
 * layout is determined by the largest width and largest height of the children. All children
 * will be arranged in a stack (aligned to the top start of the [Layout]).
 *
 * __Note__: Once the exit transition is finished, the [content] composable will be skipped (i.e.
 * the content will be removed from the tree, and disposed).
 *
 * By default, the enter transition will be a combination of fading in and expanding the content in
 * from the bottom end. And the exit transition will be shrinking the content towards the bottom
 * end while fading out. The expanding and shrinking will likely also animate the parent and
 * siblings if they rely on the size of appearing/disappearing content. When the
 * [AnimatedVisibility] composable is put in a [Row] or a [Column], the default enter and exit
 * transitions are tailored to that particular container. See [RowScope.AnimatedVisibility] and
 * [ColumnScope.AnimatedVisibility] for details.
 *
 * [initiallyVisible] defaults to the same value as [visible]. This means when the
 * [AnimatedVisibility] is first added to the tree, there is no appearing animation. If it is
 * desired to show an appearing animation for the first appearance of the content,
 * [initiallyVisible] can be set to false and [visible] to true.
 *
 * @param visible defines whether the content should be visible
 * @param modifier modifier for the [Layout] created to contain the [content]
 * @param enter [EnterTransition]s used for the appearing animation, fading in while expanding by
 *              default
 * @param exit [ExitTransition](s) used for the disappearing animation, fading out while
 *             shrinking by default
 * @param initiallyVisible controls whether the first appearance should be animated, defaulting
 *                         to match [visible] (i.e. not animating the first appearance)
