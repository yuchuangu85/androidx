/**
 * [TransitionAnimation] is the underlying animation used in
 * [androidx.compose.animation.transition] for animating from one set of property values (i.e.
 * one [TransitionState]) to another. In compose, it is recommended to create such an animation
 * using [androidx.compose.animation.transition], instead of instantiating [TransitionAnimation]
 * directly.
 *
 * [TransitionAnimation] reads the property values out of the start and end state,  as well as the
 * animations defined for each state pair for each property, and run these animations until all
 * properties have reached their pre-defined values in the new state. When no animation is specified
 * for a property, a default [FloatSpringSpec] animation will be used.
 *
 * [TransitionAnimation] may be interrupted while the animation is on-going by a request to go
 * to another state. [TransitionAnimation] ensures that all the animating properties preserve their
 * current value and velocity as they createAnimation to the new state.
 *
 * Once a [TransitionDefinition] is instantiated, a [TransitionAnimation] can be created via
 * [TransitionDefinition.createAnimation].
 *
 * @param def Transition definition that defines states and transitions
 * @param clock Optional animation clock that pulses animations when time changes. By default,
 *              the system uses a choreographer based clock read from the [AnimationClockAmbient].
 *              A custom implementation of the [AnimationClockObservable] (such as a
 *              [androidx.compose.animation.core.ManualAnimationClock]) can be supplied here if
 *              thereâ€™s a need to manually control the clock (for example in tests).
 * @param initState Optional initial state for the transition. When undefined, the initial state
 *                  will be set to the first [toState] seen in the transition.
 * @param label Optional label for distinguishing different transitions in Android Studio.
 *
 * @see [androidx.compose.animation.transition]
