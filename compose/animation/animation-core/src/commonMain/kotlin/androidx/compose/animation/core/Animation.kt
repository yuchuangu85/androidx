 * This interface provides a convenient way to query from an [VectorizedAnimationSpec] or

 * ending condition for each value or velocity query, and instead only requires the play time to be
 * passed for such queries.
 *
 * The implementation of this interface should cache the starting conditions and ending
 * conditions of animations as needed.
 *
 * __Note__: [Animation] does not track the lifecycle of an animation. It merely reacts to play time
 * change and returns the new value/velocity as a result. It can be used as a building block for
 * more lifecycle aware animations. In contrast, [AnimatedValue] and [TransitionAnimation] are
 * stateful and manage their own lifecycles, and subscribe/unsubscribe from an
 * [AnimationClockObservable] as needed.
