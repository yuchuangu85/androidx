/**
 * [TransitionDefinition] contains all the animation related configurations that will be used in
 * a state-based transition. It holds a set of [TransitionState]s and an optional set of
 * [TransitionSpec]s. It can be used in [androidx.compose.animation.transition] to create a
 * state-based animation in Compose.
 *
 * Each [TransitionState] specifies how the UI should look in terms of values
 * associated with properties that differentiates the UI from one conceptual state to anther. Each
 * [TransitionState] can be considered as a snapshot of the UI in the form of property values.
 *
 * [TransitionSpec] defines how to animate from one state to another with a specific animation for
 * each property defined in the states. [TransitionSpec] can be created using [transition] method
 * inside of a [TransitionDefinition]. Currently the animations supported in a [transition] are:
 * [tween], [keyframes], [spring], [snap], [repeatable]. When no [TransitionSpec] is specified,
 * the default [spring] animation will be used for all properties involved.
 * Similarly, when no animation is provided in a [TransitionSpec] for a particular property,
 * the default physics animation will be used. For each [transition], both the from and the to state
 * can be omitted. Omitting in this case is equivalent to a wildcard on the starting state or ending
 * state. When both are omitted at the same time, it means this transition applies to all the state
 * transitions unless a more specific transition have been defined.
 *
 * To create a [TransitionDefinition], there are generally 3 steps involved:
 *
 * __Step 1__: Create PropKeys. One [PropKey] is required for each property/value that needs to
 * be animated. These should be file level properties, so they are visible to
 * [TransitionDefinition] ( which will be created in step 3).
 *
 *     val radius = FloatPropKey()
 *     val alpha = FloatPropKey()
 *
 * __Step 2__ (optional): Create state names.
 *
 * This is an optional but recommended step to create a reference for different states that the
 * animation should end at. State names can be of type [T], which means they can be string,
 * integer, etc, or any custom object, so long as they are consistent.

 * It is recommended to either reuse the states that you already defined (e.g.
 * TogglableState.On, TogglableState.Off, etc) for animating those state changes, or create
 * an enum class for all the animation states.
 *
 *     enum class ButtonState {
 *         Released, Pressed, Disabled
 *     }
 *
 * __Step 3__: Create a [TransitionDefinition] using the animation DSL.
 *
 * [TransitionDefinition] is conceptually an animation configuration that defines:
 * 1) States, each of which are described as a set of values.  Each value is associated with a
 * PropKey.
 * 2) Optional transitions, for how to animate from one state to another.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.animation.core.samples.TransitionDefSample
 *
 * Once a [TransitionDefinition] is created, [androidx.compose.animation.transition] composable can take
 * it as an input and create a state-based transition in compose.
 *
 * @see [androidx.compose.animation.transition]
