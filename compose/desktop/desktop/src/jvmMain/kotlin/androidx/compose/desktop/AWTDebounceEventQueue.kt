/**
 * Dispatch events on the next EDT tick if they are blocking EDT too long,
 * so EDT can handle more important actions (like render a new frame).
 *
 * (EDT - AWT event dispatch thread)
 *
 * [maxNanosToBlockThread] defines how long events can block EDT.
 *
 * It is needed in a case when we have a lot of heavy events (like mouse scroll)
 * in a short period of time.
 *
 * Without dispatching events we may have a situation
 * when 30 events of scroll block AWT Thread for 1 second, without rerendering content.
