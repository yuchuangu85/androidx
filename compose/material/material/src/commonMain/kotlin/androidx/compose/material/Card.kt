 * Cards are [Surface]s that display content and actions on a single topic.
 *
 * @sample androidx.compose.material.samples.CardSample
 *
 * @param modifier Modifier to be applied to the layout of the card.
 * @param shape Defines the surface's shape as well its shadow. A shadow is only
 *  displayed if the [elevation] is greater than zero.
 * @param backgroundColor The background color.
 * @param contentColor The preferred content color provided by this Surface to its children.
 * Defaults to either the matching `onFoo` color for [backgroundColor], or if [backgroundColor]
 * is not a color from the theme, this will keep the same value set above this Surface.
 * @param border Optional border to draw on top of the card
 * @param elevation The z-coordinate at which to place this surface. This controls
 *  the size of the shadow below the surface.
