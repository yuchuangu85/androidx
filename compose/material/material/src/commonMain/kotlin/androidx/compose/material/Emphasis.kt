/**
 * Emphasis allows certain parts of a component to be accentuated, or shown with lower contrast
 * to reflect importance / state inside a component. For example, inside a disabled button, text
 * should have an emphasis level of [EmphasisLevels.disabled], to show that the button is
 * currently not active / able to be interacted with.
 *
 * Emphasis works by adjusting the color provided by [contentColor], so that emphasis levels
 * cascade through a subtree without requiring components to be aware of their context.
 *
 * The default implementations convey emphasis by changing the alpha / opacity of [color], to
 * increase / reduce contrast for a particular element.
 *
 * To set emphasis for a particular subtree, see [ProvideEmphasis].
 *
 * To define the emphasis levels in your application, see [EmphasisLevels] and [EmphasisAmbient]
 * - note that this should not typically be customized, as the default values are optimized for
 * accessibility and contrast on different surfaces.
 *
 * For more information on emphasis and ensuring legibility for content, see
 * [Text legibility](https://material.io/design/color/text-legibility.html)
