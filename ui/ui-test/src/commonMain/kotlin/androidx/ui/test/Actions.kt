 * complete and can be resumed in a later invocation of [performGesture]. It is the
 * responsibility of the caller to make sure partial gestures don't leave the test in an
 * inconsistent state.
 *
 * All events that are injected from the [block] are batched together and sent after [block] is
 * complete. This method blocks until all those events have been injected, which normally takes
 * as long as the duration of the gesture. If an error occurs during execution of [block] or
 * injection of the events, all (subsequent) events are dropped and the error is thrown here.
 *
 * This method must not be called from the main thread. The block will be executed on the same
 * thread as the caller.

 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * onNodeWithTag("myWidget")
 *     .performGesture { swipeUp() }
 *
 * onNodeWithTag("myWidget")
 *     .performGesture { click(center) }
 *
