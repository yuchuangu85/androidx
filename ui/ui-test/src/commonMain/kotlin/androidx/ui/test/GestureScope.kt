/**
 * The receiver scope for injecting gestures on the [semanticsNode] identified by the
 * corresponding [SemanticsNodeInteraction]. Gestures can be injected by calling methods defined
 * on [GestureScope], such as [click] or [swipe]. The [SemanticsNodeInteraction] can be found by
 * one of the finder methods such as [onNodeWithTag].
 *
 * The functions in [GestureScope] can roughly be divided into two groups: full gestures and
 * partial gestures. Partial gestures are the ones that send individual touch events: [down],
 * [move], [up] and [cancel]. Full gestures are all the other functions, like [click],
 * [doubleClick], [swipe], etc. See the documentation of [down] for more information about
 * partial gestures. Normally, if you accidentally try to execute a full gesture while in the
 * middle of a partial gesture, an [IllegalStateException] or [IllegalArgumentException] will be
 * thrown. However, you might want to do this on purpose, for testing multi-touch gestures, where
 * one finger might tap the screen while another is making a gesture. In that case, make sure the
 * partial gesture uses a non-default pointer id.
 *
 * Note that all events generated by the gesture methods are batched together and sent as a whole
 * after [performGesture] has executed its code block.
 *
 * Next to the functions, [GestureScope] also exposes several properties that allow you to get
 * [coordinates][Offset] within a node, like the [top left corner][topLeft], its [center], or
 * 20% to the left of the right edge and 10% below the top edge ([percentOffset]).
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * onNodeWithTag("myWidget")
 *    .performGesture {
 *        click(center)
 *    }
 *
 * onNodeWithTag("myWidget")
 *    // Perform an L-shaped gesture
 *    .performGesture {
 *        down(topLeft)
 *        move(topLeft + percentOffset(0f, .1f))
 *        move(topLeft + percentOffset(0f, .2f))
 *        move(topLeft + percentOffset(0f, .3f))
 *        move(topLeft + percentOffset(0f, .4f))
 *        move(centerLeft)
 *        move(centerLeft + percentOffset(.1f, 0f))
 *        move(centerLeft + percentOffset(.2f, 0f))
 *        move(centerLeft + percentOffset(.3f, 0f))
 *        move(centerLeft + percentOffset(.4f, 0f))
 *        move(center)
 *        up()
 *    }

 * If no pointers are down yet, this will start a new partial gesture. If a partial gesture is
 * already in progress, this event is sent with at the same timestamp as the last event. If the
 * given pointer is already down, an [IllegalArgumentException] will be thrown.
 *
 * This gesture is considered _partial_, because the entire gesture can be spread over several
 * invocations of [performGesture]. An entire gesture starts with a [down][down] event,
 * followed by several down, move or up events, and ends with an [up][up] or a
 * [cancel][cancel] event. Movement can be expressed with [moveTo] and [moveBy] to
 * move a single pointer at a time, or [movePointerTo] and [movePointerBy] to move multiple
 * pointers at a time. The `movePointer[To|By]` methods do not send the move event directly, use
 * [move] to send the move event. Some other methods can send a move event as well. All
 * events, regardless the method used, will always contain the current position of _all_ pointers.
 *
 * Down and up events are sent at the same time as the previous event, but will send an extra
 * move event just before the down or up event if [movePointerTo] or [movePointerBy] has been
 * called and no move event has been sent yet. This does not happen for cancel events, but the
 * cancel event will contain the up to date position of all pointers. Move and cancel events will
 * advance the event time by 10 milliseconds.
 *
 * Because partial gestures don't have to be defined all in the same [performGesture] block,
 * keep in mind that while the gesture is not complete, all code you execute in between
 * blocks that progress the gesture, will be executed while imaginary fingers are actively
